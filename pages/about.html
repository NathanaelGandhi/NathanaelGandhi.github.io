       <h3><a>The Journey</a></h3>
       <p>My career has offered me hands-on experience involving
              microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, ROS, computer aided design, data analysis, robot development
              and on-site commercial deployment. Primarily these areas were explored during my 3 year Research
              Assistant employment at UTS Robotics Institute (formerly Centre for Autonomous Systems). As an
              active member of UTS Robotics Society I experienced opportunities participating and organising
              competitions, community outreach, collaborative events, workshops and a range of executive
              positions including President. One of my most rewarding experiences was developing and teaching a
              robotics studio course to a wonderful class of students.</p>

       <h3><a>Behind the Scenes</a></h3>
       <p>Never one to throw my feet up after the nine-to-five, I
              find myself constantly learning and exploring the wonderful world of FOSS which has manifested in
              daily driving Linux, writing scripts, guides, self-hosting storage, networking and container
              systems. When not falling down that rabbit hole, I embrace the challenges in leading outdoor groups
              on hiking, biking, 4wding and camping adventures.</p>
