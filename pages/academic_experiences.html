	<p>Designed and built a successful robot to complete the modified Warman UTS 2019 challenge as part of a 5
		person team. Completing this project was an amazing experience I'm thankful Mechanical Design 1 encouraged
		us to undertake. I documented the design and build in more detail on <a

	<p>I developed a PID motor controller using a FPGA. Mechatronics 1 offered me the opportunity to co-author my
		own assignment as part of their student extension program “unleashed”. This was wonderfully challenging and
		a rewarding experience resulting in a FPGA PID controller that was commanded by an Arduino over SPI.</p>

	<p>My contributions include front-end UX design and implementation developed in react.js to visualise our team
		built blockchain solution designed to capitalise on a buisness opportunity within the renewable energy
		sector. We achieved 1st place out of 7 teams presenting at the 4-day Accenture mentored hackathon.</p>

	<p>My contributions include project managment, business strategy, presentation scripting, design and delivery.
		Achieving 2nd place out of 8 teams competing over this 4-day interuniversity competition, we produced a
		functional prototype and business case utilising humanitarian engineering techniques and combining water
		filtration technologies creatively.</p>
