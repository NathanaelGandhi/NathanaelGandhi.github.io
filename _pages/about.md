I am an undergraduate Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) working as a Student Research Robotics Engineer at UTS:Robotics Institute (UTS:RI), previously the Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS). Extracurriculars include being an active member of the UTS Robotics Society since 2018, participating in robotics competitions, running workshops, presentations, outreach programs and various executive positions, most notably 2019 president of the society.
